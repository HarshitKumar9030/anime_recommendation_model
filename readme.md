# Anime Recommendation System

This project is an Anime Recommendation System that uses a combination of content-based filtering and collaborative filtering to suggest anime based on user preferences. The app is built using Flask for the backend API and a simple HTML page with Tailwind CSS and JavaScript for the front end.

## Project Structure

- **main.py**: Script for training the anime recommendation model and generating required data files.
- **app.py**: Flask API that provides endpoints for anime recommendations.
- **index.html**: Front-end interface designed using Tailwind CSS and JavaScript to interact with the recommendation API.
- **/**: Directory containing the raw anime dataset used for model training.
- **anime_dataset**: Feel free to explore anime_dataset_extended_final.csv
- **.gitignore**: Configuration to ignore generated files from version control.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package manager)

### Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Flask API

Start the Flask server by running the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

The server will start at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### Front-End Interface

Open `index.html` in your web browser to interact with the recommendation system. You can use a local HTTP server to avoid any CORS issues:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000/index.html` in your browser.

## Usage

### New User Recommendations

1. **Preferred Genres**: Enter genres like "Action, Adventure, Romance".
2. **Liked Anime Titles**: Provide a list of anime titles you liked, such as "Attack on Titan, Black Clover, Kimi no Todoke, Horimiya, Mashle, Vinland Saga, Berserk".
3. Click **Get Recommendations** to see personalized anime recommendations.

### Existing User Recommendations

> **Note:** The "Existing User" recommendation feature is not working currently. Please use the "New User" option only.

## Files Ignored by Version Control

The following files are generated by the model training process and are included in `.gitignore` to avoid adding them to version control:

- `anime_model_data.csv`
- `collab_sim.npy`
- `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl`
- `content_sim.npy`
- `simulated_user_data.csv`

## Current Limitations

- The **Existing User** recommendation feature is not functional. Please use the **New User** option to get recommendations.
- The application relies on the dataset located in the `/` directory, and model training must be completed before use.

## To-Do

- Fix the existing user recommendation functionality.
- Improve the dataset quality and filtering mechanisms for more accurate recommendations.
- Add more features, such as user authentication and personalized profiles.
